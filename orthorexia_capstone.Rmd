## #WIEIAD & Obsessed with "Healthy"?

Have you ever watched "What I Eat in a Day" (WIEIAD) videos on Instagram or TikTok and thought, *"I should eat like that, too"*?

These short clips often show perfectly portioned meals, colorful ingredients, and a disciplined approach to eating that looks inspiring and healthy. For many viewers, these videos feel motivating: a glimpse into a lifestyle centered on self-care and "clean" eating.

But what if these videos are quietly shaping how we think about food in ways we don't realize?

Studies have long shown that [appearance-focused media can influence how we feel about our bodies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2024.101841). It can lead to comparison, dissatisfaction, and pressure to live up to unrealistic ideals. A similar process may be happening with food.

While eating "healthy" is generally encouraged (though what counts as "healthy" and who gets to define it is not always clear), an extreme preoccupation with healthy eating can quietly take a different turn. People may begin comparing what they eat to what others eat, feeling dissatisfied with their own meals, and developing a distorted idea of what an "ideal" diet should look like.

</div>
```

This pattern of thinking is known as ***orthorexia***. It often hides behind good intentions but [can lead to anxiety, guilt around food, and rigid eating patterns that negatively affect both mental and physical well-being](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10490497/).

This project aims to make these hidden connections easier to understand through interactive visualization that show how different types of message around food embedded in daily #WhatIEatInaDay social media content may shape perceptions of body image, health, and food.

### By Exploring This Project...

```{=html}

</div>
```

1.  You'll see how different types of WIEIAD/vlog messages can make viewers focus too much on eating "healthy"
2.  You'll learn how comparing yourself to others and feeling dissatisfied with your body can connect to an obsession with "healthy" eating
3.  You'll discover which psychological, behavioral, and social predictors make some people more prone to othorexic tendencies than others.
4.  You'll get glimpse into how viewers respond to non-restrictive weight-inclusive content, and how positive approaches to eating influence thoughts and feelings about food.

### About Data

This project used data from an online experiment with 471 young women (ages 19-25). They watched one of four types of vlogs:

1)  non-food related vlogs
2)  weight-normative diet WIEIAD vlogs
3)  weight-inclusive non-diet WIEIAD vlogs
4)  weight-inclusive non-diet WIEIAD vlogs with prompts encouraging viewers to reflect on the positive effects of "unhealthy" food

After watching, participants responded their thoughts on food, body image, and tendencies toward extreme healthy eating.

Table below gives a quick look at the data used for this project. Feel free to take a look around the data!

## Predicting Orthorexic Tendency

I performed this this that that

### Model Specification

linear regression with lasso and ridge

### Prediction

slider style: thin-ideal internalization, social appearance comparison, body dissatisfaction, self-esteem, excessive exercise / click style: wieiad message type, eating disorder treatment experience

## Common Themes in Weight-Inclusive Responses

The data includes open-ended response from people who watched weight-inclusve videos and was instructed to write their personal opinion about nonrestictive and weight-inclsuve eating habits for your overall health and well-being.

### Word Cloud

the word cloud shows that something something

## Conlcusion

In conclusion, I found that
